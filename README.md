## ðŸ§¾ Dataset

- **Name:** Unemployment_Rate_upto_11_2020.csv  
- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Unemployment in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

##  Project Workflow

1. Import necessary libraries
2. Load and inspect the dataset
3. Clean column names (remove spaces, rename Region to State)
4. Convert Date column to datetime format (dayfirst=True)
5. Calculate average unemployment rate by state
6. Create the following visualizations:
   -  Bar chart: Average unemployment rate by state
   -  Line chart: Unemployment rate over time (per state)
   -  Histogram: Distribution of unemployment rates in India

##  Results & Insights

- Bihar and Delhi reported the highest average unemployment rates.
- A clear spike in unemployment occurred between Marchâ€“May 2020, indicating the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns.
- Most unemployment rates range between 5â€“15%, with few states exceeding that.
